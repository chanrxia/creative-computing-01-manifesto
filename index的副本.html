      <p>
      Long ago, Frith made the world. He made all the stars,</br>
      too, and the world is one of the stars. He made them by</br>
      scattering his droppings over the sky and this is why</br>
      the grass and the trees grow so thick on the world.</br>
      Frith makes the rivers flow.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      They follow him as he goes through the sky,</br>
      and when he leaves the sky they look for him for</br> 
      all night.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      Frith made all the animals and birds, but when</br>
      he first made them they were all the same. The</br>
      sparrow and the kestrel were friends and they both</br>
      ate seeds and flies. </br>

      </br>
      </br>
      And the fox and the rabbit were friends and they</br>
      both ate grass. And there was plenty of grass and </br>
      plenty of flies, because the world was new and </br>
      Frith shone down bright and warm all day.</br>

      </br>
      </br>
      Then Frith said to El-ahrairah, 'Prince Rabbit, </br>
      if you cannot control your people, I shall find ways</br>
      to control them. So mark what I say.'</br>

      </br>
      </br>
      But El-ahrairah would not listen and he said to</br>
      Frith, 'My people are the strongest in the world,</br>
      for they breed faster and eat more than any of the</br>
      other people. </br>
      </br>
      </br>

      And this shows how much they love Lord</br>
      Frith, for of all the animals they are the most</br>
      responsive to his warmth and brightness. 'You must </br>
      realize, my lord, how important they are </br>
      and not hinder them in their beautiful lives.' </br>
      </br> 
      </br>

      Frith could have killed El-ahrairah at once, but </br>
      he had a mind to keep him in the world, because he </br>
      needed him to sport and jest and play tricks.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      So he determined to get the better of him, not by</br>
      means of his own great power but by means of a</br>
      trick. He gave out that he would hold a great</br>
      meeting and that at that meeting he wouid give a</br>
      present to every animal and bird, to make each one</br>
      different from the rest.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      And all the creatures set out to go to the meeting</br>
      place. But they all arrived at different times,</br>
      because Frith made sure that it would happen so.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      And when the blackbird came, he gave him his</br>
      beautiful song, and when the cow came, he gave her</br>
      sharp horns and the strength to be afraid of no other</br> 
      creature. And so in their turn came the fox and the</br>
      stoat and the weasel.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      And to each of them Frith gave the cunning and the</br>
      fierceness and the desire to hunt and slay and eat</br>
      the children of El-ahrairah. And so they went</br>
      away from Frith full of nothing but hunger to kill</br>
      the rabbits.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      All the rabbits had heard the story before: on</br>
      winter nights, when the cold draft moved down the</br>
      warren passages and the icy wet lay in the pits of the</br>
      runs below their burrows; and on summer evenings, in</br>
      the grass under the red may and the sweet, carrion-scented</br>
      elder bloom.</br>

      </br>
      </br>
      Dandelion was telling it well, and even Pipkin forgot</br>
      his weariness and danger and remembered instead the great</br>
      indestructibility of the rabbits. Each one of them saw</br>
      himself as El-ahrairah, who could be impudent to Frith</br>
      and get away with it.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
